# PygameSimulations

This repository contains various examples of games and physics simulations I have performed using the python library pygame.

## Running the programs:
You should be able to run these programs anywhere you can run python! If you are encountering issues with the matplotlib display, an easy workaround I have used time and time again is to set the matplot backend to "WebAgg". This will tell matplot to display the plot in a tornado server in your browser rather than utilizing the default python gui display. Underneath your matplotlib import, put matplotlib.use('WebAgg').

Thank you, Gavin Bosman.
